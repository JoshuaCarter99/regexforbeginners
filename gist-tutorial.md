## Summary

Hello, and welcome to my regex tutorial! I will be talking to you about the list of subjects (pertaining to Regex) shown in the Table of Contents.

Regex is short for "regular expression", and is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input. Let's take an in depth look at all the different types of regular expression!
